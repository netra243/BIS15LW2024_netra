## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above. For any included plots, make sure they are clearly labeled. You are free to use any plot type that you feel best communicates the results of your analysis.  

**In this homework, you should make use of the aesthetics you have learned. It's OK to be flashy!**

Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  

## Load the libraries

```r

## Resources
The idea for this assignment came from [Rebecca Barter's](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-11-17-ggplot2_tutorial/) ggplot tutorial so if you get stuck this is a good place to have a look.  

## Gapminder
For this assignment, we are going to use the dataset [gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html). Gapminder includes information about economics, population, and life expectancy from countries all over the world. You will need to install it before use. This is the same data that we will use for midterm 2 so this is good practice.

```r
#install.packages("gapminder")
library("gapminder")
```

## Questions
The questions below are open-ended and have many possible solutions. Your approach should, where appropriate, include numerical summaries and visuals. Be creative; assume you are building an analysis that you would ultimately present to an audience of stakeholders. Feel free to try out different `geoms` if they more clearly present your results.  

**1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of the overall structure of the data frame, including its dimensions, column names, variable classes, etc. As part of this, determine how NAs are treated in the data.**  


```r
summary(gapminder)
```

```
##         country        continent        year         lifeExp

**2. Among the interesting variables in gapminder is life expectancy. How has global life expectancy changed between 1952 and 2007?**


```r
gapminder%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(mean_exp = mean(lifeExp))%>%
  arrange(year)
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 × 2
##     year mean_exp
##    <int>    <dbl>
##  1  1952     49.1
##  2  1957     51.5
##  3  1962     53.6
##  4  1967     55.7
##  5  1972     57.6
##  6  1977     59.6
##  7  1982     61.5
##  8  1987     63.2
##  9  1992     64.2
## 10  1997     65.0
## 11  2002     65.7
## 12  2007     67.0
```

**3. How do the distributions of life expectancy compare for the years 1952 and 2007?**


```r
gapminder%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp))+
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6, color = "black", fill = "lavender", bins = 40)+
  labs(title = "Distribution of life Expentency")
```

**4. Your answer above doesn't tell the whole story since life expectancy varies by region. Make a summary that shows the min, mean, and max life expectancy by continent for all years represented in the data.**


```r
gapminder%>%
  group_by(continent)%>%
  summarise(min_life = min(lifeExp, na.rm = T),
            mean_life = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T),
            max_life = max(lifeExp, na.rm = T))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 4
##   continent min_life mean_life max_life
##   <fct>        <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1 Africa        23.6      48.9     76.4
## 2 Americas      37.6      64.7     80.7
## 3 Asia          28.8      60.1     82.6
## 4 Europe        43.6      71.9     81.8
## 5 Oceania       69.1      74.3     81.2
```


**5. How has life expectancy changed between 1952-2007 for each continent?**


```r
gapminder%>%
  group_by(continent, year)%>%
  summarise(mean_life = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_life, group = continent))+
  geom_line()
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

**6. We are interested in the relationship between per capita GDP and life expectancy; i.e. does having more money help you live longer?**
ANS: Yes

```r
gapminder%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F)
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
```

**7. Which countries have had the largest population growth since 1952?**


```r
gapminder%>%
  filter(year == "1952" | year == "2007")%>%
  group_by(country, year)%>%
  summarise(largest_pop = mean(pop), .groups = 'keep')%>%
  top_n(5, largest_pop)%>%
  arrange(desc(largest_pop))%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = largest_pop)
```

```
## # A tibble: 142 × 3
## # Groups:   country [142]
##    country           `2007`    `1952`
##    <fct>              <dbl>     <dbl>
##  1 China         1318683096 556263527
##  2 India         1110396331 372000000
##  3 United States  301139947 157553000
##  4 Indonesia      223547000  82052000
##  5 Brazil         190010647  56602560
##  6 Pakistan       169270617  41346560
##  7 Bangladesh     150448339  46886859
##  8 Nigeria        135031164  33119096
##  9 Japan          127467972  86459025
## 10 Mexico         108700891  30144317
## # ℹ 132 more rows
```

**8. Use your results from the question above to plot population growth for the top five countries since 1952.**


```r
gapminder%>%
  filter(year == "1952" | year == "2007")%>%
  group_by(country, year)%>%
  summarise(largest_pop = mean(pop), .groups = 'keep')%>%
  top_n(5, largest_pop)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = largest_pop))+
  geom_line()
```

![](hw11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->


**9. How does per capita GDP growth compare between these same five countries?**


```r
gapminder%>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)%>%
  top_n(5, country)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=gdpPercap, group=country, color=country))+
  geom_line()
```

![](hw11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->


**10. Make one plot of your choice that uses faceting!**


```r
gapminder%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = pop))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~continent, ncol = 2)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```
