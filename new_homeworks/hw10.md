## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above. For any included plots, make sure they are clearly labeled. You are free to use any plot type that you feel best communicates the results of your analysis.  

Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!

## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy? 


```r
summary(deserts)
```

```

## 
```


2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?


```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(species, genus)%>%
  count(species, sort = T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 48 × 3
## # Groups:   species, genus [48]
##    species      genus               n
##    <chr>        <chr>           <int>
##  1 merriami     Dipodomys       10596
##  2 penicillatus Chaetodipus      3123
##  3 ordii        Dipodomys        3027
##  4 baileyi      Chaetodipus      2891
##  5 megalotis    Reithrodontomys  2609
##  6 spectabilis  Dipodomys        2504
##  7 torridus     Onychomys        2249
##  8 flavus       Perognathus      1597
##  9 eremicus     Peromyscus       1299
## 10 albigula     Neotoma          1252
## # ℹ 38 more rows
```


3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.


```r
deserts%>%
  count(taxa, sort = T)%>%
  mutate(tot = n/sum(n))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = taxa, y = tot))+
  geom_col()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->



4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`


```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(plot_type)%>%
  summarise(n_taxa = n_distinct(taxa),
            tot = n())%>%
  mutate(proport = n_taxa/tot)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = plot_type, fill = proport))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  coord_flip()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->


5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.


```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  filter(weight!=is.na(weight))%>%
  summarise(range_min = min(weight, na.rm = T),
            range_max = max(weight, na.rm = T))%>%
  mutate(range = range_max - range_min)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = range, y = species))+
    geom_boxplot()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->


6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.


```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  filter(weight!=is.na(weight))%>%
  summarise(range_min = min(weight, na.rm = T),
            range_max = max(weight, na.rm = T))%>%
  mutate(range = range_max - range_min)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = range, y = species))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->


7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?


```r
deserts%>%
  filter(genus == "Dipodomys" & species == "merriami")%>%
  count(year)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = n))+
  geom_col()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->


8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.


```r
deserts%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))+
  geom_point(na.rm = T, alpha = 1.0)
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->


9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.
ANS: Highest weight is of species albigula and spectabilis.

```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  summarise(mean_highest_w = mean(weight, na.rm = T))%>%
  arrange(desc(mean_highest_w))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      mean_highest_w
##    <chr>                 <dbl>
##  1 albigula              159. 
##  2 spectabilis           120. 
##  3 spilosoma              93.5
##  4 hispidus               65.6
##  5 fulviventer            58.9
##  6 ochrognathus           55.4
##  7 ordii                  48.9
##  8 merriami               43.2
##  9 baileyi                31.7
## 10 leucogaster            31.6
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```


```r
deserts%>%
  select(weight, hindfoot_length, species, sex)%>%
  mutate(ratio_weight_to_hindfootlgth = weight/hindfoot_length)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ratio_weight_to_hindfootlgth, y = sex, fill = sex))+
  geom_col(na.rm = T)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.


```r
deserts%>%
  group_by(taxa, sex)%>%
  summarise(high_length = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = T))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = high_length, y = sex, fill = sex))+
  geom_col()
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'taxa'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```
## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).
```
